AusPostcode
================================

AusPostcode collates two CC-BY 2.5 licensed documents to provide a legal alternative to the [AusPost postcode data](http://drc.edeliver.com.au/products-and-services/download-postcode-data.html).

Very helpfully, AusPost don't have an openly licensed version of their data - so, instead, the data is sourced from two Australian Bureau of Statistics docs and have been stripped down to just Suburb and Postcode.

Discovered via http://data.gov.au/dataset/postal-areas-asgs-non-abs-structures-ed-2011/ , the two relevant documents are these:

* Postal Areas ASGS Non ABS Structures Edition 2011 in .csv Format 		
* State Suburbs ASGS Non ABS Structures Edition 2011 in .csv Format 

Both are licensed CC-BY 2.5 and so, I suppose, this is too. Sneaky, huh?
